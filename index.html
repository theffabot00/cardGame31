            Instructions: <br/>
            Get a hand totaling 31! Each turn you can draw a card from the deck or discard pile and discard a card! 
            Knock when you're satisfied with your hand. Player with the lowest hand value gets a strike at the end of each round 
            If a player gets 31, the round instantly ends and all other plays get a strike. If a knocking player has the 
            lowest hand value, that player gets two strikes. Players with three strikes are kicked out.
